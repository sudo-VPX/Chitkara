    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>
      TastyPoint began as the dream of a student from Chitkara University, Baddi. While studying and managing college
      life, food was always the biggest source of comfort and excitement. Between lectures, group projects and hostel
      life, the love for exploring new dishes kept growing.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as casual late-night cooking with friends slowly turned into a deeper passion. Experimenting with
      flavours, creating unique recipes, and serving food that made people smile became a habit. This small college
      hobby soon transformed into a bigger vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      TastyPoint was created with one goal — to bring delicious, fresh and exciting food to everyone. Every dish on the
      menu is inspired by student life, hostel cravings and the simple joy of good food shared with good people.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the heart of Baddi to your plate, this journey continues. And you are now a part of it.
